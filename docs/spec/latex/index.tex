checkygen\+\_\+example is a program which takes an integer argument as input and gives the return value "{}\+EXIT\+\_\+\+SUCCESS"{} if the argument is a multiplee of two otherwise the return value is "{}\+EXIT\+\_\+\+FAILURE"{}. \hypertarget{index_cg}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Checkygen}{Checkygen}}\label{index_cg}
checkygen\+\_\+example is not very useful but allows to show some concepts of the test environment Checkygen \hypertarget{index_ut}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unit Testing}{Unit Testing}}\label{index_ut}
For using Checkygen code has to include checkygen.\+h. checkygen.\+o is to link together with the other objects. A test needs a macro "{}\+DECLARE\+\_\+\+TEST"{} in front of the main function. It needs a macro "{}\+CREATE\+\_\+\+TEST"{} just in the beginning of the main function and a macro "{}\+REMOVE\+\_\+\+TEST"{} at the end of the main function. Each function to test starts with a macro "{}\+START\+\_\+\+TEST"{} followed by instructions for each test case and macros "{}\+TEST(a)"{} which test if "{}a"{} is true. Behind those tests a macro "{}\+STOP\+\_\+\+TEST"{} is needed. If the program starts in CHECKYGEN mode each test will be executed only one time. After this the tests are ignored. \hypertarget{index_Pt}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Pretty Testing}{Pretty Testing}}\label{index_Pt}
Checkygen allows to formulate all test cases within the functions to test. But Checkygen following the idea of Doxygen does not show the results only on stdout but exports the test results in a more pretty form. Results are incorporated into the Doxygen documentation. In the documentation of each function should be a "{}\textbackslash{}note"{} for each test which describes given input, expected output and return value. In addition to this for all tests of a function should be a predefined doxyen macro "{}\textbackslash{}\+WRN\{...\}"{} inside the function documentation\+: e.\+g. for the 5. test oft function foo() write"{}\textbackslash{}\+WRN\{foo\+\_\+5\}"{}. Then a new Doxygen documentation made after the test run shows a warning in the description of the function, if the function failed. \textquotesingle{}./checkygen\textquotesingle{} itself is nothing but a simple bash script which inserts the warnings into the doxygen-\/documentation and runs doxygen.
